# Store-Simulation
Simulation of the flow of customers through a grocery store, for ICS 46 at UCI.

While the practical use-cases of this application are limited, it required a detailed understanding of pointers, dynamic allocation, and proper deletion of dynamically allocated objects. I worked with these concepts heavily while implementing the DoublyLinkedList class, upon which I implemented a Queue using private inheritance. Overall, I was proud that my code worked without any memory leaks. The project seemed daunting at first, but I found that once I had an accurate mental model of the system, and had implemented the underlying data structures, coding it flowed relativelty smoothly.
